        decolonizing

        Post-custodial, participatory, community archives

        Uphend archives power and stuctures of dominance, erasure and authorial control *PWR &ECON*

        towards fluid ongoing and unperdicitable temporal paths

        TK and labels and workflows

    ```Notes
    	Curation focus
        Verbs but theory imposing
        Separating productive from consumptive
        Lots of focus on social media, social life
        Pick out the pieces of sorting, choosing, who gets to see
        Highlight, ignore, engage, remove data to view

    ```Notes
        I forgot how much of this was about social media and teaching.. Not a bad article still has relevant definitions and findings about the benefits/importance of the curation process in general. Could feature in the final product as a reason why we are promoting this work and creating a framework for other students so they can focus on developing the skills rather than get stuck in the methodology like me
        ----
        Social factor, collaboration, social in nature
        Different skills that are used
        Positionality
        Def. of curation and what it means at the core
        Knowledge as a construction of collaboration
        Scoop.it as a curation tool
        ! Discussion section most helpful along with intro
        - Collaboration
        - Reuse /Quality
        - Self Reflection
        - Literacy
        Interdisciplinary

    ```Notes
        Relationship between research data and records
        & between recordkeeping and research data management

        **Lit Review**
        This is a good lit review methodology to model my own after as I have multiple phases and parts, and am learning and initially including some pieces then removing

        Very good section on why disscussions and terms are hard to distinguish and consistency of terms

        Cites our other sources! Dooley
        poole / 

        very basic findings tbh, set up of paper is more important than findings

    ```Notes
    	How digital curation fits in with all the disciplines and its origin

        Academic vs professional uses
        Definitions mostly and origins and why it is so hard to talk about
        Information Lifecycle
        As a paradigm
        What its position is and what it entails (verbs on verbs)
        Lots of diagrams!!
