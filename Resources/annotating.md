    ```Notes
        I forgot how much of this was about social media and teaching.. Not a bad article still has relevant definitions and findings about the benefits/importance of the curation process in general. Could feature in the final product as a reason why we are promoting this work and creating a framework for other students so they can focus on developing the skills rather than get stuck in the methodology like me
        ----
        Social factor, collaboration, social in nature
        Different skills that are used
        Positionality
        Def. of curation and what it means at the core
        Knowledge as a construction of collaboration
        Scoop.it as a curation tool
        ! Discussion section most helpful along with intro
        - Collaboration
        - Reuse /Quality
        - Self Reflection
        - Literacy
        Interdisciplinary
