    ```Notes
        I forgot how much of this was about social media and teaching.. Not a bad article still has relevant definitions and findings about the benefits/importance of the curation process in general. Could feature in the final product as a reason why we are promoting this work and creating a framework for other students so they can focus on developing the skills rather than get stuck in the methodology like me

    ```Notes
    okay so i was worried at first but this is great support of why my work will be unoriginal and more of a collection and display of others work. THIS PROVES the curation comp is worth the time, effort, and confronts the question of "originality". Other pieces are better to explain larger implications and importance.
