### Introduction
    
*edit*, pulled straight from original

All over the world, information and communication is becoming more digitized. There is still a need for traditional disseminations of information such as posters and displays, however the rise of technology has only continued to play a larger role in our day to day discourse. At the forefront of the scholarly approach to this is the field of digital humanities. According to Digital Humanities Quarterly, an open-access peer-reviewed digital journal, "Digital humanities is a diverse and still emerging field that encompasses the practice of humanities research in and through information technology, and the exploration of how the humanities may evolve through their engagement with technology, media, and computational methods" (2021). This is one of many definitions created to describe digital humanities as a field of study. Common in many definitions is the highlight of the use of technology to communicate information gathered from the methods of the humanities. Most importantly, for the conceptualization of projects in the realm of digital humanities, is the respect of it being a newer interdisciplinary and only partially charted frontier.

A specialization within the field of digital humanities is on curation. Analog curation is the traditional method before the use of digital technologies to catalog, archive, and preserve objects, items, or other works. This is seen as the placards and common physical displays in museums but also seen as archives and libraries with labels on the objects stored and protected in collections. Digital curation is then seen as a similar process but with digital data, information, storage, and display. Digital humanities plays the important role of providing an interdisciplinary framework for collaboration in this process while digital curation acts as a tool for long-term preservation and access to necessary resources (Sabharwal, 2015, p. 12). This relationship allows for innovative work as these practices of curation are documented, combined and improved upon. The combination of analog and digital curation is now often referred to as hybrid curation. 

Digital Humanities is also known as being project-based and a field of practice. These concepts from the field need to be applied to a project to be demonstrated and analyzed. For this, I am applying the concept of hybrid curation to an item gifted to Allegheny College: an Indonesian bis pole sculpture. This object is a tall cylindrical wood carving featuring white pigments from Indonesian created post-1981 (Bocchi, n.d.). This resembles the art and wood carving style of the Asmat ritual bis poles. These were traditionally used in their cultural death rituals with important ties to Asmat religious practices (Deboratz, 2008). Since this piece does not feature some key characteristics of bis poles and is large yet without signs of external display, this piece has been determined to be an "art-for-export" work likely purchased in Jakarta in the early 1990s. The information already gathered has allowed for the beginning conceptualization of this project. However, more research will need to be completed to create a display for the object on Allegheny's campus. 


### Topic & Keywords

    ```
    ethical dissemination of information/knowledge through long-term data preservation (aka hybrid curation for our purposes)

    Social Responsibility of data, especially around preservation and presentation

    Long-term data preservation AND hybrid curation AND digital humanities AND (informatics OR anthropology)

    The main topic of this project is on the ethics and application of hybrid curation on physical objects.
    The keywords are separated into the categories of hybrid archival workflow, ethical curation, and Indonesian bis pole related terminology.

### Literature Review
  
    // What are the distinguishing characteristics of hybrid curation as a type of long-term data preservation from the persepective of digital humanists?

    // _*Written in other doc first*_

### Research Question

    How can the methods of hybrid curation be applied to items donated to Allegheny College?

### Project Aims 

My project's primary goal is to create an ethical, educational, and culturally appropriate hybrid exhibit for the Indonesian bis pole installation. This will be accomplished by completing several smaller goals before achieving this final construct.

First, I hope to attain an understanding of the ethical considerations of long-term data preservation as seen in hybrid curation. Second, I hope to attain an understanding of how hybrid curation is currently being conducted. Lastly, I hope to create a framework of archival workflow for Allegheny College that is focused on ethical displays in a public space for educational purposes which can be conducted to create the installation. 

With the completion of these pieces, this project will catalog this artifact while creating an accessible digital archive and analog exhibit. 


### Expected Final Product

*edit*, pulled straight from original

The final product of this project will be seen in three parts: a literature review, an exhibition, and a final reflective composition. The literature review will be on the methodology of hybrid curation. This literature will then be applied as the methodology is used to create a hybrid exhibit of the Indonesian bis pole gifted to Allegheny College. Lastly, the final composition will surmise the process and application while reflecting on the implications of this work in the field of Global Health. Due to the nature of this project, the analog exhibition will be displayed publicly on the campus of Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. The digital display of this exhibit will be featured through Allegheny Web services and may be accessed publicly through the internet or through the QR codes that are posted on placards in the physical exhibition. 

### Methods

Due to the construction of this project, slightly different methods will be engaged to achieve my proposed aims. The project will begin with a literature review building on the preliminary literature review that was conducted for this proposal. The second portion will utilize the knowledge gained from the literature review to utilize the methodology of hybrid curation to create an ethical archival workflow for Allegheny College's specific infrastructure. The final reflective documentation will detail the process of using these methods, elaborate on ethical considerations, and discuss the implications of this work.

The preliminary literature review was focused on the distinguishing characteristics of hybrid curation work in the digital humanities as a form of long-term data preservation. From this search, many specific projects, tools, and services were cited in the descriptions of these scholary articles. The first step will be to conduct a literature review on these projects, objectives, and tools that resemble the item and exhibit that resemble the expected final product.//


``` Lit Review
    After this prelimary literature review about "What are the distinguishing characteristics of hybrid curation as a type of long-term data preservation from the persepective of digital humanists?". 
    This lit review will shift its focus to: 
    "What practices are currently being used for hybrid curation as an anthopological, digital humanist tool?" ish

    * build from my current lit review with more focus on anthropology/museum studies or similar objects to the bis pole

    * look similar projects or specific objective accomplished by the projects
        - look at cultural heritage projects
        - (Anderson & Blanke, 2012)

    * what technology can we use or model after
        - (KÃ¤rberg, 2015), has a lot of tech talk
        - (Sabharwal, 2017)

    * This lit review will require interesting phases/parts
        - This is well modeled but (Grant, 2017), this lit review will follow a very similar methodology as Grant's
```

After completing this literature review, I will take these findings and apply them to the creation of the bis pole exhibit. This will be the main focus as it is enacting the hybrid curation methodology. An important consideration is the reasoning to do hybrid rather than just digital curation. While digital curation is sufficent to achieve the goal of long-term data preservation, it does not consider the needs of the current functioning culture on Allegheny College's campus. This gifted item is physical and will be displayed in a public location. Scholars also do not discard their analog methods with the use of new technology for their work (Maryl et al., 2020). The technology and digital archives are seen as an addition to current methods to add different ways of access and preservation to enrich information past what can be done with only analog methods. 

This will require organizing information about bis poles, their//. //I plan to begin by using  Global Health dimensions to guide the organization of the subsections such as the economic background of these wooden scupltures being art-for-export. This has the flexiblity to adjust as I discover what information is available for this piece.//
 I will be likely displaying this information in a website framework with influence from the technology services discovered in the literature review. With replication and sustainability in mind, a template will likely be created to guide future curation work. The creation of the template should allow for quick and relatively easy input of information to create a functional, accessible, and enriching digital archive. 
 
 This digital work will be paired with the analog exhibit. Interdisciplinary conversation as one of the defining charastics of this work will guide my project to dicussed across disciplines on campus before the final decisions of the differences between the two formats are finalized with their respective content. This work, overall, will act as a model for an ethical archival workflow that can be reused or even improved upon with future iterations. 
``` Application
    * hybrid curation
        - (Maryl et al., 2020), very good view of why hybrid and not just digital curation
    * web framework, form to fill out? 
    * not database, not full anthropology lit review
    * 
```

Lastly, documentation and reflection is important with this work. I will need to formalize my notes and experiences of the application process into a reusable and understandable workflow. Along with this do;; As the work of curators continue to decolonize its practices by adding time for reflexivity (Christen & Anderson, 2019), I will add this time throughout but dedicate this last third of my work to directing future curators through the ethics and other implications of this work. 
``` Reflection

    * proper ethics
        * slow archives
            - (Christen & Anderson, 2019)
            * discussion on Pwr & Econ, reflection on decolonizing archives
    * archival workflow for future curation
        * documentation
            - (Abrams, 2021)
            * was it successful? How can we measure this? What should we be recording and looking at?
            * Accessibility, Integrity, Authenticity, and Usability
            * The communicative/managerial experience vs the artifactual/ experiential one.

    * areas for expansion or further interdisciplinary work (solidify scale and scope here)
        * I will not be creating an aggregator or database, rather a model dataset for a single item in the database
        * I will not be doing the full anthropological lit review of the item. I will just be pulling already complete research with guidance from the department to assure the quality of the exhibition project
        * I will be setting a model and framework to be applied to all other items donated to the college to make a faster process with room for growth by other students and their projects thus allowing for a student without a cmpsc or informatics background to contribute to the space with their research or a more experienced techincal student to improve features on the cyberinfrastructure. 
        * I will be starting the groundwork for fluid curation for cross-campus collaboration.

### Budget

The estimated budget of this project is $150 as it is necessary for the exhibition portion of this work. The texts I am using for my literature review are free and publicly available or accessed through the Allegheny library services. The digital space and software are already available under the existing Allegheny digital infrastructure. The piece will need to be properly displayed, in a currently undetermined location, in efforts to preserve the materials and color of the bis pole along with proper installation costs which will not be addressed in this budget. For the budget requested, the entirety will be used for creating appropriate placards for the exhibit of the bis pole. This is divided between the material that would allow for appropriate mounting, ensure durability of the display, and demonstrate continuity with existing placards across campus.
