Simply, information and communication in general are becoming more digitized. 
While there is still a need for traditional methods like posters or physical exhibits, technology is playing a larger role
Out of this has spun multiple new disciplines like Digital Humanities and Digital Curation
Digital Humanities in particular is the combination of humanities like anthropology and computer science
Digital Curation has evolved into its own field but also as a method for long term data preservation that overarches many other disciplines making it an interesting method in Digital Humanities.
This methodology of curation is important to note as an application or project- based approach,

====RESEARCH QUESTION
Thus my project, focused mainly on hybrid curation (a mix of digital and traditional analog curation), needed an object to work with. 
A problem, yet an opportunity for me, became available with the donation of this Indonesian bis pole to Allegheny College that needs a proper display to be attached to its installation. Thus my research question has become how can we apply these methods of hybrid curation to items donated to the College.

====METHODS
To answer this question, I have broken my methods into three sections: Literature Review, Application, and Reflection.
My literature review will build upon my preliminary one that was conducted for this project proposal. This will be moving from the original question about what curation is to how it is currently being used in projects similar to our own. 
Next is application where I will be using what I have learned, like specific technology, tools, and techniques to create the hybrid exhibit. This will have a digital footprint in Allegheny's cyberinfrastructure and an analog piece seen as physical placards with QR codes to link the two. 
Last but perhaps more important, is reflection and documentation. Though this will be interspersed within the first two sections as well, I will be setting aside time to turn my notes into formal documentation, creating an archival workflow that can then be applied to other objects or gifts on campus.
This time will also be used for reflexivity. Since curators act as mediators between the public and information, history, and memory, the responsibility of how the exhibits can be interpreted differently by changing audiences is an important consideration. 

====GHS DIMENSIONS
Connecting this to the Global Health Studies Dimensions, the process of curation has stakes in each section.

For science and the environment, computer science will be playing a large role in my work. I will be using the systematic epistemology to create an easily replicable process for future curation. This will also feature aspects of web development to create my digital portion of my exhibit that is functional and ADA compliant.
For power and economics, I have been focused on the history of collection that rooted in colonialism as it creates a hierarchy of those who own and collect. This history of curation will be important to recognize as I aim to create a workflow that does not continue these old harmful practices.
This is blended into the social responsibility that curators have. Through intermediation, curators have the social responsibility to properly represent the information while not conducting any form of bias or erasure, either through ill intent or negligence. 
Lastly the object or artifacts that are being curated represent and are data of the culture or society that it originates from. This long-term data preservation not only preserves the information about the item but the surrounding contexts as well. 
Overall, I see my project not only joining the new frontier in digital humanities and digital curation research but also contributing to the larger discussions about information preservation and dissemination.

Though not I will not be conducting original research on the object, this is the work of curators as they construct and add meaning to the information just from organization.
