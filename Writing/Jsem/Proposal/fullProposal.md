### Introduction
    
All over the world, information and communication are becoming more digitized. There is still a need for traditional disseminations of information such as posters and displays, however the rise of technology has only continued to play a larger role in our day to day discourse. At the forefront of the scholarly approach to this is the field of digital humanities. According to Digital Humanities Quarterly, an open-access peer-reviewed digital journal, "Digital humanities is a diverse and still emerging field that encompasses the practice of humanities research in and through information technology, and the exploration of how the humanities may evolve through their engagement with technology, media, and computational methods" (2021). This is one of many definitions created to describe digital humanities as a field of study. Common in many definitions is the highlight of the use of technology to communicate information gathered from the methods of the humanities. Most importantly, for the conceptualization of projects in the realm of digital humanities, is the respect of it being a newer interdisciplinary and only partially charted frontier.

A specialization within the field of digital humanities is on curation. Analog curation is the traditional method before the use of digital technologies to catalog, archive, and preserve objects, items, or other works. This is seen as the placards and common physical displays in museums but also seen as archives and libraries with labels on the objects stored and protected in collections. Digital curation is then seen as a similar process but with digital data, information, storage, and display. Digital humanities plays the important role of providing an interdisciplinary framework for collaboration in this process while digital curation acts as a tool for long-term preservation and access to necessary resources (Sabharwal, 2015, p. 12). This relationship allows for innovative work as these practices of curation are documented, combined and improved upon. The combination of analog and digital curation is now often referred to as hybrid curation. 

Digital Humanities is also known as being project-based and a field of practice. These concepts from the field need to be applied to a project to be demonstrated and analyzed. For this, I am applying the concept of hybrid curation to an item gifted to Allegheny College: an Indonesian bis pole sculpture. This object is a tall cylindrical wood carving featuring white pigments from Indonesian created post-1981 (Bocchi, n.d.). This resembles the art and wood carving style of the Asmat ritual bis poles. These were traditionally used in their cultural death rituals with important ties to Asmat religious practices (Deboratz, 2008). Since this piece does not feature some key characteristics of bis poles and is large yet without signs of external display, this piece has been determined to be an "art-for-export" work likely purchased in Jakarta in the early 1990s. The information already gathered has allowed for the beginning conceptualization of this project. However, more research will need to be completed to create a display for the object on Allegheny's campus. 

Though this is not traditionally connected to physical health, this composition is still important to the field of global health. Information preservation and dissemination are vital in society for education and improvement. This data is also qualitative, often not reused due to epistemological differences. With distrust in our ability to reuse qualitative data, the study of global health is not optimizing its use of resources, which are so often scarce. This methodology will hopefully start our ability to promote data reuse and sharing. In its interdisciplinary nature, interlinking of sources across disciplines is especially important for global health as we attempt to change perspectives on global issues related to health. This item will be looked at with an interdisciplinary lense to make a well-rounded exhibit featuring economic, religious, societal, environmental effects on the wellbeing of those who made the item. This project is not entirely focused on the item.  When making an educational display about an item, the effects of making an unethical display harm the wellbeing, especially mental and social, of those who have connection to the item. The mediation of curators such as myself with training in global health will be looking for how the item itself relates to health but will also strive to improve the methodology we use to cause no harm, now or for future viewers of this exhibit. 


### Topic & Keywords

-- I am merging this into the introduction of the literature review and the  introduction section

    ```
    ethical dissemination of information/knowledge through long-term data preservation (aka hybrid curation for our purposes)

    Social Responsibility of data, especially around preservation and presentation

    Long-term data preservation AND hybrid curation AND digital humanities AND (informatics OR anthropology)

    The main topic of this project is on the ethics and application of hybrid curation on physical objects.
    The keywords are separated into the categories of hybrid archival workflow, ethical curation, and Indonesian bis pole related terminology.

    ```

### Literature Review
  
    // What are the distinguishing characteristics of hybrid curation as a type of long-term data preservation from the persepective of digital humanists?

    // _*Written in other doc first*_

### Research Question

    How can the methods of hybrid curation be applied to items donated to Allegheny College?

### Project Aims 

My project's primary goal is to create an ethical, educational, and culturally appropriate hybrid exhibit for the Indonesian bis pole installation. This will be accomplished by completing several smaller goals before achieving this final construct.

First, I hope to attain an understanding of the ethical considerations of long-term data preservation as seen in hybrid curation. Second, I hope to attain an understanding of how hybrid curation is currently being conducted. Lastly, I hope to create a framework of archival workflow for Allegheny College that is focused on ethical displays in a public space for educational purposes which can be conducted to create the installation. 

With the completion of these pieces, this project will catalog this artifact while creating an accessible digital archive and analog exhibit. 


### Expected Final Product

The final product of this project will be seen in three parts: a literature review, an exhibition, and a final reflective composition. The literature review will focus on the current practices and uses of hybrid curation. This knowledge will then be applied as the methodology to create a hybrid exhibit for the donated Indonesian bis pole. Lastly, the final composition will surmise the process and application of hybrid curation while reflecting on the implications of this work in the fields of Global Health and Informatics. Due to the nature of this project, the analog exhibition will be displayed publicly on the campus of Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. The digital display of this exhibit will be featured through the institution's web services and may be accessed publicly through the internet or through the QR codes that will be displayed on placards in the physical exhibition.  

### Methods

Due to the construction of this project, slightly different methods will be engaged to achieve my proposed aims. The project will begin with a literature review building on the preliminary literature review that was conducted for this proposal. The second portion will utilize the knowledge gained from the literature review about hybrid curation methodology to create an ethical archival workflow specific to Allegheny College's infrastructure. The final reflective documentation will detail the process of using these methods, elaborate on ethical considerations, and discuss the implications of this work.  

This literature review part of my work has two distinct parts. The preliminary literature review was focused on the distinguishing characteristics of hybrid curation work in the digital humanities as a form of long-term data preservation. From this search, many specific projects, tools, and services were cited in the descriptions of these scholarly articles. The first step following this work will be to conduct a literature review on these projects, objectives, and tools that resemble the item and exhibit that resemble the expected final product. This structure follows similar literature review methodology as conducted by Grant with his review of data management perspectives (2017). Inspired by her work, I also found the need to start with a phase of definitions and distinguishing characteristics followed by another phase focused on how this new field functions in practice. This leads this second phase to focus on what is currently being used for hybrid curation as an anthropological, digital humanist tool. 

After completing this literature review, I will take these findings and apply them to the creation of the bis pole exhibit. This will be the main focus of my project as it is enacting the hybrid curation methodology.

An important decision that has been made is to do hybrid rather than just digital curation. While digital curation is sufficient to achieve the goal of long-term data preservation, it does not consider the needs of the current functioning culture on Allegheny College's campus. This gifted item is a physical object and will be displayed in a public location on the campus. A physical installation with placards for the object has already been determined as part of the final product. Often scholarly practices still include both analog and digital methods and work today when engaging with archives and research (Maryl et al., 2020). The technology and digital archives are seen as an addition to current methods to add different ways of access and preservation to enrich information past what can be done with only analog methods (Sheffer & Hunker, 2019; Siddiqui, 2015). This reasoning further advances the necessity to complete this project with hybrid curation rather than just digital. 

One of the ways to add meaning to the archive is the ability to reorganize and link data, whose capacities only increase with the digital format. This work for the hybrid display will require organizing and connecting this display to information about bis poles. I will be likely displaying this information in a website framework with influence from the technology services discovered in the literature review. I plan to begin organizing the information by using Global Health dimensions to guide the organization of the subsections such as the economic background of these wooden sculptures being art-for-export. This has the flexibility to adjust as I discover what information is available for this piece.

With replication and sustainability in mind, a template or bare framework will likely be created to guide future curation work. The creation of this template should allow for quick and relatively easy input of information to create a functional, accessible, and enriching digital archive. My work of adding the additional sections will act as a guide for future curation that can build upon the basic template. Overall, this application of hybrid curation will act as a model for an ethical archival workflow that can be reused or even improved upon with future iterations. 

Lastly, documentation and reflection is important with this work. After finishing the display, I will need to formalize my notes and experiences of the application process into a reusable and understandable workflow. This will only be feasible, logistically, with work integrated into all parts of the project with extra dedicated time towards the conclusion. 

As curators continue to decolonize their practices by adding time for reflexivity (Christen & Anderson, 2019), I will add this time throughout my process but dedicate this last third of my work to reflexivity. The documentation should and will include conversations and thought processes around actively incorporating ethics considering other implications of this work. This work will function with intermediation (Sabharwal, 2017) which is one of the large conversations occurring amongst curators and other digital humanists. Other considerations such as representation and power will be heavily considered as well as this display is out of the context of the culture and society it is representing and created by curators. 

These ethical considerations lead into how to measure the success of the exhibit. This construct of success cannot be directly or indirectly observed. Abrams (2021) suggests from their research that we can use the proxies of accessibility, integrity, authenticity, and usability to gauge the success of an archive. This will lead me to interdisciplinary collaboration as we work through these questions of how to successfully use digital tools for a functional final product while conveying the integrity of the exhibit as I act in the role of curator.

### Global Health Context

Global Health Studies is an interdisciplinary field that can be split into four distinct dimensions: science and the environment, power and economics, ethics and social responsibility, and culture and society. In the reflection of my project, there are two foci as I contextualize my work in the field of Global Health Studies. First, I highlight the implications of the hybrid curation methodology. Second, I focus on the object of curation, the bis pole, which has its own history, narrative, and implications in each of these dimensions. 

*Hybrid Curation*

With the lens of digital humanities, I will be working mostly with the science seen in the field of computer science. I will be working with architecture code and software to create a website exhibit as the digital footprint for the Indonesian bis pole display. This will feature many concepts of web development to create a structure that is ADA compliant and easily replicable. Looking at larger contexts, this framework can be repeated and applied to many different objects at Allegheny. With even broader contexts, this use of a hybrid approach for disseminating information can add to the conversation in health communication. The pairing of computer science skills with the work in Global Health, anthropology and other traditionally analog methods can allow for innovative approaches to broadcast information for larger audiences.	

Another concept central to this project is power relations in curation and the creation of exhibits. Curation and displays of objects can be made for the preservation of culture but are sometimes not made by representatives of the culture. It is vital to recognize the positionality of the creator of the display as well as who is featured, able to speak, or considered an expert. These concepts of power are dynamic and often unclear of who is to be ignored and left out of the narrative created by the exhibits. The history of collection is deeply rooted in colonialism as it creates power hierarchies that can allow for authorial control and erasure (Christen & Anderson, 2019). As erasure of culture is to one extreme of unethical curation, these power relations are important to recognize in the misrepresentation and treatment of others. These lack of acknowledgements often degrade the healthcare of those from minorities as the majority overtakes the health narrative. Diverse representations allow for knowledge circulation that can improve the equity of treatment and policies. 

Thirdly, this proposed exhibit is created to be ethical. An ethical display is difficult to navigate with many questions that need to be asked recursively. Such questions include "What data/information should be collected, presented, stored, or preserved?", "Is there more value being placed on certain voices over others?", "How and where should objects be displayed or should they be returned?" These questions are important as items and information is traded globally. The harm of unethical displays can be seen in the consequences of stigmatization, emotional and mental health degradation, lawsuits, or demonstrations of violence. This social responsibility of curators is seen in the data collecting, storing, and sharing of trustworthy information in sustainable ways for reuse. Without curators acting in the best interest of society as a whole, the work completed is unlikely to be ethical, reusable, or sustainable and potentially cause harm such as culture erasure.  


*Indonesian bis pole*

Focused on the ecological and built environment, I will be focused on the materials of the bis pole and their interaction with human health. The wood used in this object is likely Ironwood which has important ties to the economy. The physical properties of the wood allowed for the pigments to not seep into the wood itself. The colors also displayed on the piece were created by the use of white clam shells or clay. These pigments are able to stay on the bis pole without adhesion. The creation of these exports had an effect on the environment and the people themselves. Part of my exhibit will feature details on these materials and their effects on the population interacting with them.  

An important feature of this object is that it is an export. This bis pole was created for the purpose of being sold. Being an art-for-export piece also brings to rise the concepts of tourism and resource allocation. This object was made from materials that were not all from one region and furthermore used materials like ironwood that could have been used for other purposes. The economics of the region where this resource was originally made may shed light on the condition and lifestyles of the people in the region. The demographics and job market may also be an important factor of why these pieces were being made for export. 

Lastly, this bis pole is from a specific culture, the Asmat culture and its people. This cultural context is important as I look into who made it, what it represents, and why this bis pole was created. Traditional bis poles in the Asmat culture have a long history of being part of tribal death rituals and were used for specific purposes. Though this gifted bis pole does not have the same purpose, the context of this is still important as these people and their culture are represented by this object. This in the larger context brings questions related to material culture and what practices, beliefs, and values we can derive from this piece. Stigmatizations and judgements are often formed from outside the originating community which can be instigated by improper displays of objects outside their original context.

### Budget

The estimated budget of this project is $150 for the exhibition portion of this work. The texts I am using for my literature review are free and publicly available or accessed through the Allegheny library services. The digital space and software for the digital exhibit are already available under the existing Allegheny digital infrastructure. The gifted item will need to be properly displayed, in a location on campus that is currently undetermined, to preserve the materials and colors of the bis pole along with proper installation costs which will not be addressed in this budget. For the budget requested, the entirety will be used for creating appropriate placards for the exhibit of the bis pole. This total will be divided between the material that would allow for appropriate mounting, ensure durability of the display, and demonstrate continuity with existing placards across campus.
