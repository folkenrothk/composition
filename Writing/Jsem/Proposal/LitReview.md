Long-term data preservation has been a growing topic of interest throughout the many disciplines. From natural sciences to social sciences to humanities, data is a vital part of the research and work associated with these fields. Curation has been a common type of long-term preservation for items, physical or digital, experiencing some new changes and innovation as technology and needs evolve with time.  While traditional analog and digital methods are still utilized, hybrid curation has been the approach to achieve As this evolution becomes more digital and applied to the fields of the humanities, new disciplines have emerged, even explicitly called digital humanities. This information guided a larger search for literature on the matter. Starting the search was the decision of what database or service to use. Due to the very interdisciplinary nature of the field, Allegheny College's Pelletier AggreGator was chosen to conduct the search. The keywords entered were "long term data preservation AND hybrid curation AND digital humanities AND (informatics OR anthropology)" to reach the desired articles that featured ethics, anthropology and computer science discussion. Finally, the filter of "scholarly and peer reviewed" as well as the limit to publications in the last ten years narrowed the search to 74 articles that were combed through to conduct this literature review. Many of the sources I found only address digital curation as hybrid curation literature is much less common. The added complexity of modern technology has become an important conversation but does not act solely apart from traditional curation. This addition of digital is what separates hybrid curation from other curation methods. With these available sources, I hope to determine the distinguishing characteristics of hybrid curation as a type of long-term data preservation from the perspective of digital humanists.
	Though these have been briefly introduced, many terms like data, information lifecycle, archive, and digital curation have carried many definitions as they have been moved through different fields of study. Within Higgins' paper (2018), they explore how digital curation has become its own mature disciple that overarches information science. This origin of digital curation growing into what they deem a "sub-meta-discipline" creates interesting dynamics with other disciplines as it "transcends and influences all of [information science's] disciplines and sub-discipline" (Higgin, 2018, pp. 1332). This difficulty is even discussed by Grant in his paper about research data management (2017). They explain how there is a severe lack of distinction between digital curation, data curation, and research data management to such an extent that in discussions on practices, digital collection may include analog material. This highlights the same difficulty of the literature found in this review as many of these just refer to hybrid or mixed materials as a part of digital curation. 
As curation as its own discipline continues to be nailed down, definitions and theories are still being developed for curation. Seen as a process, digital curation is the user's interactions with the structure of the digital archive (Davis, 2017). From the perspective of library and information science, this work is seen within the many associated skills and roles of data science (Virkus & Garoufallou, 2019). In the nine roles proposed, three roles completely overlap the discussion of what curation is in the digital humanities. These roles include data manager, data librarian, and data steward/curator. This sectioning in data science further proves the need to not be restrictive on the terminology of what hybrid curation is in publications. This forces us to rely on the vague definition of curators working on ways to disseminate information to users through mediums, physical or digital.
This is the most useful
	One of the important parts of the curator's job is seen as adding meaning to collected, stored, and displayed information.

is the work of adding meaning to the information through the organization of the work //

 		One difficulty about curation is the concept of intermediation. There is a strong argument for disintermediation (Sabharwal, 2017) 

One of the distinguishing factors is the importance of collaboration, especially with interdisciplinary teams.  /// This is helpful as it highlights the necessity of having multiple perspectives on the same archive or project. // varying practices that can create new innovative standards to improve the ethics of collection. There is no set practice in the work to follow or even review projects for their ethicality. Social responsibility as curators

```

Another factor from the literature is the combined concepts of use, reuse, and sharing of data.
Some argue that qualitative data cannot be reused by anyone but the original researcher(s) due to epistemology of the work that those without firsthand knowledge are missing too much context. 
 This also focuses more on the quality of the archive etc idk

Along with the information being able to be reused, the reproducibility and sustainability of curation is growing to be an important topic in the digital humanities.

	After the completion of curation work, one difficulty derived from the nature of the project is how to measure its success. While other fields may have more obvious ways to measure the success of their work, curation lacks specific standards to judge their success. Abrams attempts to capture this in four categories for evaluating the success of digital preservation (2021). These four categories are accessibility, integrity, authenticity, and usability. This reflects many of the distinguishing factors of digital curation. Integrity and authenticity show the responsibilities of the curator(s) to be transparent and construct a trustworthy workflow. Accessibility and usability reflect the use, reuse, and sharing of the work. As this focuses on the experience of the user and quantifying these categories for measuring success, it also summarizes the important characteristics of curation work.
	With these factors in mind, this methodology /// with a necessity to be aware of ethical concerns that are attached to my project. After parsing through these themes from the literature, it will be worthwhile to look specifically at projects that have already been created that can model or guide this project's use of technology or tools. These sources will act as "seed articles" for this next literature review as many projects were cited to explain these themes.
