```postIntro
	Recognizing the history of the item
    what info was given to me 
    what it was recognized 
```

```Q/A

following the discussion of what to do with items

    repatriation
    responsibility 


our trust and questioning of the information given to us 

```


```Conclude case with

Not me problems: 
– !installation 
    - and that it already occurred
– the future of the item
– future display and curation


other considerations
```
 if someone was commissioned to create the archive and curate this item, how do they prove prove authentication

 where is it going, what should it be made out of, sterile environment, can people touch it 


accept vs curate 
    where is the starting point?
 
    if they just accept

        how can it include infm justice and digital curation

        antique roadshow:: whats it worth ? monetary and status worth? vs cultural contect
        

        needs a more robust process to accept, curate, and display 

        employ more folks or consultants at the ready
