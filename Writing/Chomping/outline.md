# Comp Outline
## Kate Folkenroth - 4.10 

Using the information you've already found for your topic, write an outline for your comp. What information will go where? What is the work of each chapter? (Think along the lines of what you will SAY and what you need the chapter to DO.)

Choose a section to draft. Write it out as best you can. Include citations as you can. Including notes to yourself about what needs to be included is ok!
