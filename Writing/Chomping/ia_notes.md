### Europeana

        >Anderson & Blake
        https://www.europeana.eu/en


    based in cultural heritage

    created as exhibits // digital exhibits

    "good to know"  "all metadata" "location"

    chapters (heavy research/book style) vs very basic thing (just metadata)

    || I like the flexible scale for the amount of info in an exhibit
    update dates? how was it created?



### TELDAP

    Very difficult to navigate

    a collection of collections
        very linked, and linked externally;; nothing internal until you are inside of the collection

        must pick site underneath to explore further
