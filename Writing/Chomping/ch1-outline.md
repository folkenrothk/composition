Evaluating Archives
	  After the completion of curation work, one difficulty derived from the nature of the work is how to measure its success. While other fields may have more obvious ways to measure success, curation lacks specific standards to judge this abstract concept of success. Abrams attempts to capture this in four categories for evaluating the success of digital preservation (2021). These four categories are accessibility, integrity, authenticity, and usability. This unsurprisingly reflects many of the distinguishing factors of digital curation that have been common in the literature. Accessibility and usability are integral to user experience. //add about these first two/. Accessibility and usability reflect the use, reuse, and sharing of the work. Integrity and authenticity are crucial in attempts to prove ethical intermediation. These ideas highlight the responsibilities of the curator(s) to be transparent and construct a trustworthy workflow. This transparency can also help reduce various future replication crises (Slingerland et al., 2020) that may occur in many fields. Integrating transparency by documenting an archival workflow can improve the reproducibility and sustainability of archives. // dont just end it here/

	// lil conclusion?  /The novelty of the discipline reinforces our need to rely on the umbrella definition of digital curators: those who collect, organize, and then disseminate information to users digitally. //For this project, I will be working with the practice and methodologies rather than the discipline. //

Scoping Review
This literature cannot stand alone to envision the entirety of what must be considered when conducting digital curation. Current practices must also be considered as published is often retrospective and often does always reflect details on technical, ethical, and general humanities considerations. This can be conducted with scoping review modified information architecture analysis of published archives. These were chosen from the articles selected for the literature review. The analysis is modified to reflect the findings from the literature review highlighting the accessibility, integrity, authenticity, and usability. Technical practicality was also taken note of such as file types, data structure, and metadata standards which were not often featured in the reviewed literature.

""
The selected examples for analysis cover a range of topics and represent a variety of global  // approaches to archiving. # are created and hosted by academic institutions. # were created // through funding by governments or large initiatives.

	```Findings: mission statements reflect lit review
	Accessibility, usability, integrity, and authenticity

transparency 

	```

```Findings: tech practicality

    php, html, xml, rdf

# use some form of dublin core standards.
# use xml schema, # of # were TEI-XML etc

    accessibility

    outsourcing: https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/
 {{ what it means outsourcing and not building standards (ch3)}}
```

```Findings: linkage

severe lack of connection between exhibits and archived items (aka their metadata)

```

```Findings: disciplinarity\

who created 
highly reflective originators discipline, so
	not labeled or told  who made it
	identifying the 
	announcement of positionality and reflectivity
```


With these two approaches to gathering information on digital curation, this has reflected
the current and best practices of digital curation. These findings are all to be considered in the creation of the archival workflow for Allegheny College.

I think you navigate that one section well -- maybe take out "indigenous" and say S.EA carving techniques that may be x,y,z in origin -- or something like that.

Also, you can say something about how Gift Planning and Institutional Advancement had done some background research and shared it with you.
