    types of history [Nietzsche]: https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2015/10/15/philosophy-of-history-part-xiv-friedrich-nietzsche-history-as-art/
        Nietzsche's three registers of historical practice are monumental, antiquarian, and critical. In short, monumental history is about activity and ambition, antiquarian history is about preservation and admiration, and critical history is about abolition and liberation.

digitization vs curation

interdisciplinarity & terminology

dynamic yet standardized methods
a call for innovating institutions

}}}

!! Digitization vs curation;; digitization is a significant part of digital curation. Digital curation explicitly acknowledges the fact of intermediation and the addition of meaning while digitization does not. Not that digitization does not add meaning or perpetuate values as we already know from the fact of technology systems not being neutral. if this were just a computer science research project, it would just be digitization but because I worked with an interdisciplinary lense bringing in my studies from global health and anthropology this is a project on curation. Many scholars are disciplinarily focused, my position as a dual interdisciplinary major has allowed for me to explore the project and produce a coded project and the added meaning. Though this has resulted in drawbacks as well. More collaboration should be done before any of this research is used in "full production." This project is more of a proof of concept.
Conclusions

```
recommendation = don't just rely on literature, it is necessary for interdisciplinary eyes on this, archives can be improved structurally but this will never alleviate all of the underlying problems, {my claims about radicalizing archives and move to impermeant archives, traveling collections and blockchain items}

```

radicalize archives
groups sharing standards, resources, costs, and items 

–
claim
archives are not able to be permanent structures

reimagine a future with temporary archives
access to different or more resources

role of institutions 
– waypoint, middle man, connect scholars and undergrads
— warehousing / on campus displays
more interest and already pursuing (role of institutional repositories)

===
the future of this item I've been working w/ is not set in stone
I have practical reflection that the item will be here for some span of time 
should it be used/seen/displayed elsewhere?
should it be displayed at the institution it was given to?

At this stage, collaboration is necessary and I believe the collegient resources will benefit the future interactions with the item 

Will it stay here forever?
I don't think it should
Yet at this point, place, and time; it should stay until it can be added to another collection or space and gain or add meaning/context/ or further understanding.

More than anything this item has sparked something great at Allegheny:
a deep and complex conversation of ethical proceedings with items received. 

There will be those daunted to interact in this sphere but it is vital for those of us willing to enter this sphere to be open to being wrong, learning, and continually pursue the morally right actions.
