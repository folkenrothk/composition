bulleted, looking for just outline and re-aligning with the rest of the proposal

Would still like to reflect keywords and topic in introduction of lit review

### Research Question

How can the methods of digital curation be used to promote ethical preservation of information for items donated to Allegheny College?

### Project Aims

My project's primary goal is to use digital curation for  ethical, educational, and sustainable preservation of Indonesian bis pole. This will be accomplished by completing several smaller goals before achieving this final construct. 

First, I hope to attain an understanding of the best practices and current tools used for long-term data preservation and digital curation. Second, I hope to create a framework of archival workflow for Allegheny College. This will be focused on ethical displays in public spaces for educational purposes which can be later used for the creation of an installation. 

With the completion of these pieces, this project will catalog this artifact while creating an accessible digital archive connected to the physical item.


### Expected Final Product

The final product of this project will be seen in three parts: a literature review with paired analysis, a digital archive, and a final reflective composition. The literature review will focus on the best practices of curation and act as a guide for the analysis. This will be an information architecture analysis of the website collections mentioned in the literature. This knowledge of practices, technology, and techniques will then be applied as I curate the donated Indonesian bis pole. With the completion of the digital archive,  the final composition will surmise the process and application of hybrid curation while reflecting on the implications of this work in the fields of global health and informatics. The digital archive will be created and ran through GitHub pages which can be accessed publicly on the internet.


### Methods **

Due to the construction of this project, the methods will be uniquely specific to my project to achieve the proposed aims. The project will begin with a literature review and information architecture analysis that will build from the preliminary literature review that was conducted for this proposal. The second portion will utilize the knowledge gained from this first step to utilize the methodology of digital curation to create an ethical archival workflow for Allegheny College's  infrastructure. The final reflective documentation will detail the process of using these methods, elaborate on ethical considerations, and discuss the implications of this work.

Reflection -- documentation, archival workflow

### Global Health Context **
```
Can we develop themes that hit multiple dimensions? Rather than segmenting by dimension
```
Global Health Studies is an interdisciplinary field that can be pedagogically split into four distinct dimensions: science and the environment, power and economics, ethics and social responsibility, and culture and society. My proposed project intersects with these dimensions on many levels. I will be distinguishing the intersections on the micro-level of my project in respect to the bis pole then move into larger implications of digital curation that connect to global health. 

*Digital Curation*
    Just as we will continue to evaluate the status of the bis pole, digital curation methodology has strong connections to global health. 

```
Cmpsc, Web Development, Web Accessibility (sci/ social responsibility)   
Positionality (ethics/ culture/ pwr)
```

*Indonesian Bis Pole*

    Though we are still confirming the origin and story of this wooden art sculpture, we recognize that this item is an Indonesian (likely Asmat) art-for-export bis pole. My work will only dive deeper into these connections to then be displayed in the archive created through digital curation.

```
    Material it is made from (resource extraction for a living, tourism, globalization)
    Why it was created
    Who/what it represents?... history story etc
```


*Cultural Heritage Preservation*

```
 Decolonizing collections //  Culture erasure/preservation (pwr/ culture/ ethics)
 museums and health-- especially with cultural heritage
```

### Budget

This project will not require a budget. The texts I am using for my literature review are free and publicly available or accessed through the Allegheny library services. The digital space and software for the digital exhibit are already available under the existing Allegheny digital infrastructure. The potential installation of the gifted item will not be considered as a part of this project.
