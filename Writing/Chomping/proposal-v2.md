### Introduction

```Notes
bulleted, looking for just outline and re-aligning with the rest of the proposal

```

### Literature Review

```Notes
Would still like to reflect keywords and topic in introduction of lit review

```

### Research Question

How can digital curation be used to promote ethical preservation of information of items donated to Allegheny College?

### Project Aims

My project's primary goal is to use digital curation for  ethical, educational, and sustainable preservation of Indonesian bis pole. This will be accomplished by completing several smaller goals before achieving this final construct. 

First, I hope to attain an understanding of the best practices and current tools used for long-term data preservation and digital curation. Second, I hope to create a framework of archival workflow for Allegheny College. This will be focused on ethical displays in public spaces for educational purposes which can be later used for the creation of an installation. 

With the completion of these pieces, this project will catalog this artifact while creating an accessible digital archive connected to the physical item.


### Expected Final Product

The final product of this project will be seen in three parts: a literature review with paired analysis, a digital archive, and a final reflective composition. The literature review will focus on the best practices of curation and act as a guide for the analysis. This will be an information architecture analysis of the website collections mentioned in the literature. This knowledge of practices, technology, and techniques will then be applied as I curate the donated Indonesian bis pole. With the completion of the digital archive,  the final composition will surmise the process and application of hybrid curation while reflecting on the implications of this work in the fields of global health and informatics. The digital archive will be created and ran through GitHub pages which can be accessed publicly on the internet.


### Methods

Due to the construction of this project, the methods will be uniquely specific to my project to achieve the proposed aims. The project will begin with a literature review and information architecture analysis that will build from the preliminary literature review that was conducted for this proposal. The second portion will utilize the knowledge gained from this first step to utilize the methodology of digital curation to create an ethical archival workflow for Allegheny College's  infrastructure. The final reflective documentation will detail the process of using these methods, elaborate on ethical considerations, and discuss the implications of this work. 

```Notes
Lit Review for best practices
Information architecture analysis

Application -- coding, 
    information organization

Reflection -- documentation, archival workflow
    De colonization, reflexivity

```

### Global Health Context

```Notes
    Use both sections: 
     Macro - curation
     Micro - bis pole
    Need to find a balance

```

    Will likely not need a budget anymore
