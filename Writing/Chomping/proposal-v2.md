### Introduction

```Notes
bulleted, looking for just outline and re-aligning with the rest of the proposal

```

### Literature Review

```Notes
Would still like to reflect keywords and topic in introduction of lit review

```

### Research Question

How can digital curation be used to promote ethical preservation of information of items donated to Allegheny College?

### Project Aims

My project's primary goal is to create an ethical, educational, and culturally appropriate hybrid exhibit for the Indonesian bis pole installation. This will be accomplished by completing several smaller goals before achieving this final construct. 
```
NEW GOAL: make sure we are preserving our information/data in a sustainable and ethical way. (make this more tangible? or just wprded better)
```
First, I hope to attain an understanding of the current tools and techniques used for long-term data preservation and hybrid curation. Second, I hope to create a framework of archival workflow for Allegheny College. This will be focused on ethical displays in public spaces for educational purposes which can be conducted to create the exhibit for installation. 
With the completion of these pieces, this project will catalog this artifact while creating an accessible digital archive and analog exhibit.


### Expected Final Product

### Methods

```Notes
Lit Review for best practices
Information architecture analysis

Application -- coding, 
    information organization

Reflection -- documentation, archival workflow
    De colonization, reflexivity

```

### Global Health Context

```Notes
    Use both sections: 
     Macro - curation
     Micro - bis pole
    Need to find a balance

```

### Proposed Timeline

*Refer to Google Docs*

### Budget

```Notes
    Will likely not need a budget anymore
