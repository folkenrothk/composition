# Extra notes for v2 of the proposal

## Intro
    
```
    Information is becoming more and more digitized. Understandably so as well, it reaches larger audiences and allows for long-term storage that seems invincable..


    **if nothing else my current classes are teaching me that I should not rely on the internet as an all powerful beast that cannot be destoryed or an impenetrable force that cannot be stopped avoided or changed. Fact of the matter is that the internet is quite the opposite. It is very mutable and should be challenged and changed. And the problems that come from colonialism and structural violence can be avoided with ethical and mindful programmers. 

    Stop putting faith into the All Powerful Internet, put faith in to the diversity and reflexive programmers and users that make the internet what it was, is, and can be.

## Lit Review

```Notes
Would still like to reflect keywords and topic in introduction of lit review

Intro more of the digital curation here >> curation developing over time and digital being new and un standardized (subject to curators application of agreed standards) very unique for other spaces >> what is currently happening as digital curation> into current best practices

Long-term data preservation has been a growing topic of interest throughout the many disciplines. From natural sciences to social sciences to humanities, data is a vital part of the research and work associated with these fields. Curation has been a common type of long-term preservation for items, physical or digital, experiencing some new changes and innovation as technology and needs evolve with time.  While traditional analog and digital methods are still being utilized, hybrid curation has been the approach to achieve a harmony between the two and reach the broadest audiences.

## RQ trial and error

How can the methods of digital curation be used to promote ethical preservation of information for items donated to Allegheny College?

How can the method of digital curation be used to create an archival workflow for Allegheny College items not home to a specific discipline?

## Methods

```Notes


Lit Review for best practices
Information architecture analysis

Application -- coding, (why just digital)
    information organization 

Reflection -- documentation, archival workflow
    De colonization, reflexivity




    a literature review and an information architecture analysis that will build from the preliminary literature review that was conducted for this proposal. The second portion will utilize the knowledge gained from this first step to utilize the methodology of digital curation to create an ethical archival workflow for Allegheny College's  infrastructure. The final reflective documentation will detail the process of using these methods,

## GH Context 

```
Can we develop themes that hit multiple dimensions? Rather than segmenting by dimension

*Digital Curation*

  Digital curation, overall, is important to //
    
  Based in the discipline of computer science, my digital archive will be using the skills of web development. This work will be focused on web accessibility. Mindful of design to be accommodating for those with various needs such as color blindness or who use screen readers.

--This composition is still important to the field of global health, though this is not traditionally connected to physical health. Information preservation and dissemination are vital in society for education and improvement. This data is also qualitative which is not often reused due to epistemological differences (Karcher et al., 2021). With distrust in our ability to reuse qualitative data, the study of global health is not optimizing its use of 
resources, which are so often scarce. This methodology will hopefully start our ability to promote data reuse and sharing. In its interdisciplinary nature, interlinking of sources across disciplines is especially important for global health as we attempt to change perspectives on global issues related to health. This item will be looked at with an interdisciplinary lense to make a well-rounded exhibit featuring economic, religious, societal, and environmental effects on the wellbeing of those who made the item. This project is not entirely focused on the item.  When making an educational display about an item, the effects of making an unethical display harm the wellbeing, especially mental and social, of those who have connection to the item. This has most often been seen with already vulnerable populations and minorities such as indigenous groups. The mediation of curators such as myself with training in global health will not only be looking for how the item itself relates to health but will also strive to improve the methodology we use to cause no harm, now or for future consumers of this exhibit.

    Material it is made from (resource extraction for a living, tourism, globalization)
    Why it was created (commodification of culture)
    Who/what it represents?... history story etc

 Decolonizing collections //  Culture erasure/preservation (pwr/ culture/ ethics)
 museums and health-- especially with cultural heritage

 kept for education not exoticism
