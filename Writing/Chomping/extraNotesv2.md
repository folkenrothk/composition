# Extra notes for v2 of the proposal

## Intro
    
```
    Information is becoming more and more digitized. Understandably so as well, it reaches larger audiences and allows for long-term storage that seems invincable..


    **if nothing else my current classes are teaching me that I should not rely on the internet as an all powerful beast that cannot be destoryed or an impenetrable force that cannot be stopped avoided or changed. Fact of the matter is that the internet is quite the opposite. It is very mutable and should be challenged and changed. And the problems that come from colonialism and structural violence can be avoided with ethical and mindful programmers. 

    Stop putting faith into the All Powerful Internet, put faith in to the diversity and reflexive programmers and users that make the internet what it was, is, and can be.

## Lit Review

```Notes
Would still like to reflect keywords and topic in introduction of lit review

Intro more of the digital curation here >> curation developing over time and digital being new and un standardized (subject to curators application of agreed standards) very unique for other spaces >> what is currently happening as digital curation> into current best practices

Long-term data preservation has been a growing topic of interest throughout the many disciplines. From natural sciences to social sciences to humanities, data is a vital part of the research and work associated with these fields. Curation has been a common type of long-term preservation for items, physical or digital, experiencing some new changes and innovation as technology and needs evolve with time.  While traditional analog and digital methods are still being utilized, hybrid curation has been the approach to achieve a harmony between the two and reach the broadest audiences.
